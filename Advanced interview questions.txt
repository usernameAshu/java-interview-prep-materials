1. Difference between Spring Framework and Spring Boot .

2. Different scopes of Spring beans 

3. What is the enhancement of hashmap implementation in java 8 ?

4. What is Spring AOP ? 
    -cross cutting concerns
    -aspects as class 
    -methods as Advices
    -point cut 
    -joint point 
    -XML configuration implementation 
    -AspectJ implementation

5. Garbage collection : What is MetaSpace ? How does it differ from PermGen ? 
    --Needs study 

6. What is a multi catch block ? (pipelining)

7. Hibernate: List out benefits of CriteriaQuery in hibernate : 
    --Another way for data retreival
    -Writing the native sql in object oriented format 
    -No performace benefit over HQL. 

8. What are the types of Cascades supported in JPA ? 
    -Persists: 
    -Merge: 
    -Detached: 
    -Refresh: 
    -Removed: 
    -ALL: 

9. What is Microservices ? Why we are using it ? 
    -increased fault tolerance 
    -increase flexibility of scalability 
    -ability to chose the correct tech stack for the microservices 
    -faster time to market 
    -easy debugging (isolation of issue in 1 service)

JVM architecture: (https://youtu.be/ZBJ0u9MaKtM)

    Operation of JVM is to load and execute your app:
    Main components of JVM:

        Class loader subsystem 
            |
            |
            V 
        Runtime Data Areas 
            |
            |
            V 
        Execution Engine 
    
    Class loader subsystem:
        -load :loading byte code(.class) to the memory 
            -Bootstrap class loader (rt.jar) 
            -Extension class loader (jars in jre/lib)
            -Application class loader (CLASSPATH)

        -link :
            -Verify: looks into bytecode, checks compatibility 
            -Prepare : memory is allocated for the static variables and default values assigned
            -Resolve : all symbolic reference are resolved 

        -initialize:
            -static blocks are executed 
            -static variables are assigned the actual values 

    Runtime Data Area:
        -Method area: 
            -known as Permgen, 64MB -default
            -Class data (static variables, byte code)
            -If Permgen is Full -> OutOfMemoryException occurs 
            - -XX:MaxPermSize
            -From Java 8 , Permgen/Method area is removed. And Metaspace is created in the native OS. 
                Metaspace doesn't have any space constraints. 

        -Heap area:
            -Object data is stored 
            -To control heap size: -Xms 
            -Heap area is created per JVM 
            -this area is shared across all threads 
        
        -PC registers:
            -Program Counters 
            -Its is created per Thread 

        -Java Stacks:
            -Created per thread
            -methods called are stacked up in the thread stack 
            -Thread1 cannot see the Thread2 method execution 
            -throws StackOverFlowError if Stack frame calls itself recursively infinte time. 
            -For tuning java stacks: -Xss
