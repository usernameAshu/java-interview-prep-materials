Oauth Theory: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEqkD1zlT3E)

Authorization layer is separated from authentication layer
Earlier SAML authentication was not able to provide access for particular 
resource to any request. It was providing the entire content of the resource server.
It was a claim based authentication as the Oauth 

OAuth is an authorization layer in the identity layer. 

Roles of Oauth :
    Resource Owner  
    Application/Client 
    Authorization Server
    Resource Server
    Resources 

Resource Owner (user) will use Application to access any Resource (protected) on Resource Server
For that User need an acknowledgement from Authorization server.

1. Registration of Client: 
    Autorization server needs some sort of info to identify your application
    Application registers on the Authorization Server. 
    Authorization server issues a Client ID & Client Secret
    Client ID is specific for the application 
    Authorization identifies this "ClientID" to identify the Applicationj and decide on the requests coming from that application 

2. Client Type:
    Confidential
    Public 
    
3. Client Profiles:
    Web application
    Native Client application

Generic flow of oauth:

Users       Application/Client           Authorization Server          Resource Server 
     ---1-------->              -----2------->/authorize                 
                                 <------3-------                

                                ---------4------>/token                                             
                                <---------5-----
                                -------------------6-------------------> /fetchResource
                                <-------------------7-------------------
    <---8--------

when user trying to access Protected resource on server.

Oauth2.0 FLows: 
    1. Authorization Code grant flow
    2. Client Credential flow 
    3. Resource Owner password flow
    4. Implicit flow
