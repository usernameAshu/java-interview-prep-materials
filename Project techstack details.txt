Project techstack: 
Microservice based architecture 
Frontend apps are developed using JS and React library 
Authentication services are using Kong Authentication 
API gateway is also developed using Node JS 
Backend services are developed using Java, Node JS, GoLang 
For each Microservice there is a single DB, which is of PostgreSQL 
Caches are implemented using Redis 
For cloud deployment we are using AWS services 
Our application are dockerized along with the DB , and deployed in Amazon ECS 
We are also using Amazon S3 buckets, to store files 
Code are stored in Github repo
For CICD we are using Jenkins server, which pulls the latest code from Git repo, builds and deploys in AWS ECS 
We are using Kibana to view the Application logs,
Also, using Amazon cloudwatch using sends alerts through Slack channels 

Price Platform Microservice:
Techstack: 
Developed using Java and SpringBoot framework
For connecting to DB we are using mybatis-framework as a Java persistence tool 
Maven is used a build tool 
for Unit testing : JUnit with Mockito library 
Using docker-compose files to dockerize the app
We are using PostGreSQL as DB, Cache is done in Redis, SQL file versioning done using Flyway 
Code coverage : Jacoco (maven plugin: jacoco-maven-plugin)
Application, DB and Redis cache are dockerized and depoyed in ECS
